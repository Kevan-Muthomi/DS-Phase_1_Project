   by Kevan Muthomi Ndwiga
## Introduction
Over the years, Microsoft has seen multiple 'big' companies such as Box Office Mojo, IMDB, The Numbers, The Movie and Rotten Tomatoes venture into creation of novies and they have observed the need of delving into the industry which seems rather lucrative as attributed to the success of the featured films at the box office. 

To achieve this, they intend to conduct research in the industry and come up with decisions that may inform their movie creation strategy

## Problem Statement
Microsoft's new movie studio aims to enter the competitive film industry by creating original content. However, lacking expertise in movie production, the studio faces the challenge of understanding the dynamic landscape of successful movies at the box office. 

The objective is to leverage exploratory data analysis (EDA) on diverse movie datasets from sources like Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers to identify and interpret trends, patterns, and influential factors contributing to box office success. By extracting actionable insights, the studio seeks to inform strategic decisions regarding the types of films to produce, considering genre preferences, budget allocation, critical ratings, and audience reception.

Ultimately, this analysis aims to guide Microsoft's new movie studio in crafting a targeted content creation strategy aligned with market demands and audience expectations.
